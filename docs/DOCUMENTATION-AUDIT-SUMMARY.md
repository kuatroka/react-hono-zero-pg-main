# Documentation Audit Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-17  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Objective

Review all documentation to ensure:
1. No outdated technological decisions
2. No conflicting information
3. No confusing content
4. Everything aligns with actual implementation

---

## 📋 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **openspec/project.md** - OUTDATED ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Described app as "real-time messaging application"
- Listed messages/users/mediums as primary domain
- Missing entities table, search, legacy charts

**Fix:**
- Updated to describe entities management (investors/assets)
- Added counter & charts as demo feature
- Added React Router, uPlot to tech stack
- Updated domain context with entities system details

### 2. **openspec/changes/mvp-full-implementation/README.md** - INCORRECT ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Referenced separate `investors` and `assets` tables (wrong - single `entities` table)
- Referenced non-existent files: `phase-2-investors-assets.md`, `data-generation.md`, `database-schema.md`
- Incorrect data model showing two separate tables

**Fix:**
- Updated to reflect single unified `entities` table
- Removed references to non-existent files
- Corrected data model with actual schema
- Updated search implementation code examples
- Added preloading details

### 3. **openspec/changes/add-quarterly-counter-charts/** - STATUS CLARIFIED ✅ UPDATED
**Problem:**
- Original proposal mentioned TanStack Router
- Didn't reflect actual implementation (React Router used instead)
- Unclear implementation status

**Fix:**
- Added "✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED" banner with implementation date
- Clarified that React Router was used instead of TanStack Router (architectural improvement)
- Listed all completed features (charts, API, database)

### 4. **README.md** - INCOMPLETE ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem:**
- Missing features overview
- No mention of entities/search functionality
- No link to detailed architecture docs

**Fix:**
- Added features section with emojis
- Listed all major features (search, charts, sync)
- Added link to CURRENT-STATE.md for detailed info

### 5. **Root-level PHASE-*.md files** - SCATTERED ✅ CONSOLIDATED
**Problem:**
- 9 separate implementation log files in root directory
- Confusing to navigate
- No single source of truth

**Fix:**
- Created CHANGELOG.md consolidating all phase logs
- Kept original files for reference (can be archived later)
- Added clear timeline and rationale for each phase

---

## 📚 New Documentation Created

### 1. **CURRENT-STATE.md** (New - 450 lines)
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for current architecture

**Contents:**
- What the app does (features overview)
- Complete architecture (tech stack, data model, search implementation)
- Bundle size metrics
- Development instructions
- Implementation history (Phase 1, 2.1, 2.2)
- Key architectural decisions with rationale
- Success criteria (all met)
- Future enhancements
- References

**Why:** Provides complete picture of current state without needing to read multiple docs

### 2. **CHANGELOG.md** (New - 350 lines)
**Purpose:** Consolidated implementation history

**Contents:**
- Phase 2.2: Zero-Sync Search (complete)
- Phase 2.1: PostgreSQL FTS (rolled back)
- Phase 2: Entities & Search (complete)
- Phase 1: Router Migration (complete)
- Pre-Phase 1: Initial state
- Key architectural decisions
- Bundle size history
- Success metrics

**Why:** Single place to understand what was done, when, and why

## 🎯 Key Corrections Made

### 1. **Table Structure**
**Before:** Documentation said separate `investors` and `assets` tables  
**After:** Correctly documents single unified `entities` table with `category` column

### 2. **Search Implementation**
**Before:** Vague or missing details about search  
**After:** Clear documentation of Zero-sync ILIKE queries with preloading

### 3. **Routing**
**Before:** Mixed references to TanStack Router and React Router  
**After:** Clearly states React Router v7.9.4 is used, TanStack Router was removed in Phase 1

### 4. **Bundle Size**
**Before:** No bundle size information  
**After:** Documented 567KB (182KB gzipped) with history of changes

### 5. **Architectural Decisions**
**Before:** No explanation of why certain choices were made  
**After:** Each major decision documented with rationale (single table, React Router, Zero-sync search, preloading strategy)
